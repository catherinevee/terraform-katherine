# GitHub Actions Workflows for Terraform-Katherine

This directory contains GitHub Actions workflows designed for secure, compliant infrastructure deployment with SOC2 Type II and PCI-DSS Level 1 controls for financial services workloads.

## Workflow Overview

### ðŸ”’ Security and Compliance Scan (`security-scan.yml`)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive security scanning and compliance validation
**Triggers**: Push/PR to main/develop, daily scheduled scans, manual dispatch
**Security Features**:
- Multiple security scanners (TFSec, Checkov, Trivy, OWASP Dependency Check)
- SOC2 and PCI-DSS compliance validation
- SARIF report generation for GitHub Security tab
- OIDC-based AWS authentication (no long-lived secrets)
- Script injection protection
- Pinned action versions for security

### âœ… Infrastructure Validation (`validate.yml`)
**Purpose**: Terraform/Terragrunt validation, testing, and cost analysis
**Triggers**: Push/PR to main/develop, manual dispatch
**Features**:
- Terraform format and validation checks
- Terragrunt dependency validation
- Infrastructure testing with Terratest
- Cost estimation with Infracost
- Security policy validation
- Parallel job execution for performance

### ðŸš€ Infrastructure Deployment (`deploy.yml`)
**Purpose**: Secure infrastructure deployment with approval gates
**Triggers**: Manual dispatch only (security requirement)
**Security Features**:
- Environment protection rules
- Manual approval gates for production
- Rollback capabilities for failed deployments
- Pre-deployment security scans
- OIDC-based AWS authentication
- Deployment notifications

### ðŸ“‹ Compliance Monitoring (`compliance.yml`)
**Purpose**: Automated compliance validation and reporting
**Triggers**: Weekly scheduled scans, manual dispatch
**Compliance Standards**:
- SOC2 Type II (CC1-CC5 controls)
- PCI-DSS Level 1 (Requirements 1-6)
- Automated compliance reporting
- Audit trail generation

## Security Controls Implemented

### 1. Script Injection Protection
- âœ… No direct use of `${{ github.event.* }}` in run commands
- âœ… User-controlled inputs assigned to environment variables
- âœ… No dynamic command execution without sanitization
- âœ… PR code not checked out in security-sensitive jobs

### 2. Token and Permissions Security
- âœ… Explicit `permissions` blocks with minimal required access
- âœ… GITHUB_TOKEN has read-only permissions by default
- âœ… Job-specific permissions where appropriate
- âœ… OIDC implementation for AWS authentication
- âœ… No long-lived secrets for cloud providers

### 3. Third-Party Action Security
- âœ… All actions pinned to specific versions
- âœ… Actions from verified publishers (GitHub, HashiCorp, AWS)
- âœ… No actions using 'main' or 'master' branches
- âœ… Security-focused action selection

### 4. Secrets Management
- âœ… No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- âœ… Environment-specific secrets properly scoped
- âœ… Secrets never printed in logs or outputs
- âœ… GitHub Environments with protection rules
- âœ… OIDC for AWS/Azure/GCP authentication

### 5. Dangerous Trigger Events
- âœ… No use of `pull_request_target` that checks out PR code
- âœ… Manual `workflow_dispatch` with input validation
- âœ… Branch protection integration
- âœ… Environment protection rules

## Performance Optimizations

### 6. Caching Strategy
- âœ… Latest actions/cache@v4 for dependency caching
- âœ… Appropriate cache keys using hashFiles()
- âœ… Cross-OS cache sharing where applicable
- âœ… Docker layer caching opportunities identified

### 7. Job Parallelization
- âœ… Jobs run in parallel where possible
- âœ… Matrix strategy for multi-platform builds
- âœ… Concurrency controls to prevent duplicate runs
- âœ… Appropriate timeout-minutes at job and step levels

### 8. Artifact Management
- âœ… Reasonable artifact retention periods (7-90 days)
- âœ… Compression for large artifacts
- âœ… Artifact size optimization

## Compliance Features

### SOC2 Type II Controls
- **CC1 - Control Environment**: IAM roles, security groups, KMS encryption
- **CC2 - Communication and Information**: CloudWatch logging, VPC Flow Logs, audit logs
- **CC3 - Risk Assessment**: Encryption, backup policies, monitoring
- **CC4 - Monitoring Activities**: CloudWatch alarms, SNS notifications, Lambda automation
- **CC5 - Control Activities**: Auto-scaling, backup automation, patch management

### PCI-DSS Level 1 Requirements
- **Req 1 - Firewall Configuration**: VPC, security groups, network ACLs
- **Req 2 - Secure Configuration**: Encryption, SSL certificates, secure protocols
- **Req 3 - Cardholder Data Protection**: Encryption at rest/in transit, key management
- **Req 4 - Secure Transmission**: TLS, HTTPS, VPN connections
- **Req 5 - Vulnerability Management**: Patch management, security updates, vulnerability scanning
- **Req 6 - Access Control**: IAM roles, user management, privileged access control

## Required Secrets

Configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

```bash
# AWS OIDC Role ARN for authentication
AWS_ROLE_ARN=arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/github-actions-role

# Infracost API key for cost analysis
INFRACOST_API_KEY=ico_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Slack webhook URL for notifications (optional)
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/xxx/yyy/zzz
```

## Environment Configuration

### GitHub Environments
Configure the following environments in your repository:

1. **dev**: Development environment
2. **staging**: Staging environment  
3. **prod**: Production environment (with protection rules)

### Environment Protection Rules
For production environment:
- âœ… Required reviewers (minimum 2)
- âœ… Wait timer (5 minutes)
- âœ… Deployment branches (main only)
- âœ… Environment-specific secrets

## Usage Instructions

### Running Security Scans
```bash
# Manual security scan for all environments
gh workflow run security-scan.yml -f environment=all

# Security scan for specific environment
gh workflow run security-scan.yml -f environment=prod
```

### Validating Infrastructure
```bash
# Validate infrastructure for development
gh workflow run validate.yml -f environment=dev

# Validate with cost analysis
gh workflow run validate.yml -f environment=staging
```

### Deploying Infrastructure
```bash
# Generate deployment plan
gh workflow run deploy.yml -f environment=staging -f action=plan

# Apply deployment (requires approval)
gh workflow run deploy.yml -f environment=prod -f action=apply
```

### Running Compliance Checks
```bash
# Full compliance check
gh workflow run compliance.yml -f compliance_standard=all

# SOC2 compliance only
gh workflow run compliance.yml -f compliance_standard=soc2
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### Structured Logging
- âœ… `::notice::` for informational messages
- âœ… `::warning::` for non-critical issues
- âœ… `::error::` for critical failures

### Deployment Notifications
- âœ… Slack/Teams integration
- âœ… Email notifications (via webhooks)
- âœ… GitHub deployment status updates

### Metrics Collection
- âœ… Deployment frequency tracking
- âœ… Lead time for changes
- âœ… Mean time to recovery (MTTR)
- âœ… Change failure rate

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **AWS Authentication Failures**
   - Verify OIDC role ARN is correct
   - Check role trust policy includes GitHub Actions
   - Ensure role has required permissions

2. **Compliance Check Failures**
   - Review infrastructure configurations
   - Check for missing security controls
   - Verify environment-specific settings

3. **Deployment Failures**
   - Check environment protection rules
   - Verify approval requirements
   - Review rollback procedures

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting the secret:
```bash
ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG=true
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep workflow actions updated to latest versions
2. **Access Reviews**: Regularly review GitHub repository permissions
3. **Secret Rotation**: Rotate secrets and API keys periodically
4. **Audit Logs**: Monitor GitHub audit logs for suspicious activity
5. **Environment Isolation**: Maintain strict separation between environments

## Compliance Documentation

### Audit Trail
- All workflow runs are logged in GitHub Actions
